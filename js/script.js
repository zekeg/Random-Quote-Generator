/******************************************
Treehouse FSJS Techdegree:
project 1 - A Random Quote Generator

notes on 6.16.2019 :
This program contains an array of "quote objects", containing quotations and their metadata
The program currently takes a quotation at random from the array and displays it along with several pieces of metadata,
but only if the object has that particular named attribute of metadata,

The program also changes the background color into a randomly gererated rgb value;
  a function randomRGB() was created to return a random number in the 0-255 range

The program will switch to a new quote at an interval of milliseconds dictated by setInterval()
